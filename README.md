Project Overview

This project allowed me to showcase my competencies in SQL and data visualization within the context of banking. The goal was to create an intuitive, interactive dashboard that provides stakeholders with a clear view of the bank's financial performance and potential risks associated with non-performing loans.

    SQL (BigQuery): Data import, merging, and calculation of key performance indicators (KPIs), along with tracking their changes over time.
    Tableau Public: Built a dynamic, interactive dashboard to visualize financial data, making the real-time financial situation accessible and straightforward.

ðŸ’¡ What I Did in Each Tool

    SQL (BigQuery): Imported and merged tables, calculated KPIs, and analyzed time-based trends to track loan performance.
    Tableau Public: Designed an interactive dashboard that allows stakeholders to easily access and interpret key financial metrics.

ðŸŽ¯ Results

The final dashboard provides a data-driven view of the bankâ€™s financial health, displaying essential performance indicators and identifying potential risks, such as non-performing loans, to aid in strategic decision-making.
